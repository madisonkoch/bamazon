# Welcome to **Bamazon**
## About Bamazon
This node app simulates the customer side of buying products. The customer can select one product (by product id) and the quantity they want for that product. After inputing the id and quantity they will have one of three resulting message types:
- Total cost of selection (i.e. price x quantity).
- Insufficient quantity and what quantity is available.
- Out of stock.

After each resulting message the customer will be asked if they wish to purchase another or different product. If they choose yes, the customer will start at the beginning of the product selection process. If they choose no, they will be (1) thanked for shopping with Bamazon or (2) told to check back soon if their desired product was out of stock.
